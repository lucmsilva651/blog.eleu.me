title: Recent laptop upgrades
description: My dear friend donated me some things to help me upgrade my laptop.

Recently, my special friend donated to me a 240GB SSD and 8GB of DDR4 RAM for my laptop.
I don't know if I can mention him, so he'll stay anonymous for now.

I am very grateful, as it helped so much... 4GB of RAM in 2024 is nothing! Yea, if you are reading that, thank you so much!

I am just waiting for the opportunity to buy a "HDD caddy" or a external adapter to use my old 1TB HDD who is sitting around somewhere...

But you guys can help too! If you are a Brazilian, just give a tip to me via Pix: lucmsilva651@gmail.com

But, that's it. I don't really know what to put in a blog post and I just want to make this active... So, bye for now!

``` java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("I love y'all guys!")
    }
}
```
{: file="HelloWorld.java" }
