Hi fellas!

This is the first official post of the blog and I don't really know what to put here. But I liked testing Jekyll with Markdown, so I will try to make this blog as active as possible.

If you don't know anything about me, you can read my [biography][bio] that I also made with Jekyll...

But for now, that's it. Bye.
