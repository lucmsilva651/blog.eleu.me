title: Setting up Jekyll on Windows is boring (my opinion)
---
Hi fellas!
Do you guys think how long it takes to setup an already running website on Jekyll on Windows for local development?

Well... Think about setup Ruby, the gems and the Jekyll dependencies. I have finally done with that.
It don't takes more than 15 minutes, but it is very boring...

I had so many problems that I almost gave up with this thing.
But then everything went smoothly after I "grabbed" some files from the GitHub repo of the theme I'm using in Jekyll (please forgive me lmao).
