title: Comments are now enabled with Giscus
---
Hi everyone! I'll do some things here on the blog, and now I have enabled comments here on my blog with Giscus! You will need to login with GitHub to make comments, but it's easy and I think you do it in less than a minute.

You can test comments here on this post if you want (comment anything, but don't act like a random teenager or a creep)

And that's it. There is nothing much to say than that, so bye everyone!

{% highlight c %}
// hello.c

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  printf("Hello world!");
}
{% endhighlight %}
